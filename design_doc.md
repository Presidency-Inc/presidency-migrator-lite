## **1. Introduction**

This document outlines the design for Phase 1 of the TestRail to Xray migration tool. The goal is to develop a tool that can extract test cases and associated data from TestRail and import them into Xray for Jira, facilitating a smooth migration process for Asset Mark.

---

## **2. Objectives**

- **Integrate with the TestRail API** to extract all necessary data, including test cases, sections, attachments, and custom fields.
- **Understand and map the data structures** between TestRail and Xray to prepare for data transformation.
- **Implement a secure and efficient backend** that handles data extraction, transformation, and import processes.
- **Develop a user interface (UI)** that allows users to input configuration details and trigger the migration process.
- **Ensure data integrity and accuracy** throughout the migration process.
- **Lay the groundwork** for subsequent phases by establishing a solid foundation in Phase 1.

---

## **3. Scope**

- **In Scope:**
  - Integration with TestRail API for data extraction.
  - Data transformation to match Xray's data format.
  - Integration with Xray API for data import.
  - Secure handling of API credentials.
  - Development of a simple UI for user input.
  - Testing and validation of the migration process.

- **Out of Scope:**
  - Migration of historical test execution results.
  - Advanced UI features (e.g., field mapping customization).
  - Integration with other systems or tools beyond TestRail and Xray.
  - Performance optimization for large-scale data (to be addressed in future phases).

---

## **4. Architecture Overview**

The migration tool will follow a modular architecture, consisting of the following components:

- **Backend Module:**
  - **API Clients:** Modules to interact with TestRail and Xray APIs.
  - **Data Extraction Layer:** Handles fetching data from TestRail.
  - **Data Transformation Layer:** Maps and transforms TestRail data to Xray's required format.
  - **Data Import Layer:** Handles sending data to Xray.
  - **Configuration Loader:** Manages secure storage and retrieval of API credentials.
  - **Logging and Error Handling:** Tracks the migration process and handles exceptions.

- **Frontend Module (UI):**
  - **Input Forms:** Allows users to enter TestRail and Xray configuration details.
  - **Progress Indicator:** Provides feedback on the migration status.
  - **Trigger Mechanism:** Initiates the backend migration process.

- **FR9:** The system shall log the migration process and provide meaningful error messages.

### **5.2 Non-Functional Requirements**

- **NFR1:** The system shall securely handle and store API credentials, preventing unauthorized access.
- **NFR2:** The system shall be built using Python for the backend and a suitable framework for the UI (e.g., Flask).

---

## **6. Design Considerations**

- **API Limitations:** Be mindful of TestRail's API rate limits and use bulk endpoints where possible.
- **Data Mapping Complexity:** Custom fields may not have direct equivalents in Xray; mapping logic must be flexible.
- **Security:** API credentials should not be exposed in logs or error messages; use environment variables or encrypted storage.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to manage API errors, network issues, and data inconsistencies.
- **Scalability:** While Phase 1 focuses on a sample project, the design should consider scalability for larger datasets.
- **User Experience:** The UI should be intuitive, requiring minimal input to initiate the migration.

---

## **7. Implementation Plan**

### **7.1 Part 1: Backend Implementation**

#### **7.1.1 Setup Secure API Connections**

- **Objective:** Establish secure connections to TestRail and Xray APIs using stored credentials.
- **Tasks:**
  - Create a configuration file (`.env` or `config.yaml`) to store API URLs, usernames, and API keys.
  - Implement a configuration loader module to read and securely handle these credentials.
  - Ensure that the configuration file is excluded from version control (e.g., via `.gitignore`).

#### **7.1.2 Data Extraction from TestRail**

- **Objective:** Extract all necessary data from TestRail, handling pagination and rate limits.
- **Tasks:**
  - Set up an API client using the TestRail Python binding or `requests` library.
  - Implement authentication using API keys.
  - Fetch the list of projects and identify the project ID for the sample project.
  - Fetch test suites (if applicable), sections, and test cases using appropriate endpoints.
  - Handle pagination by implementing limit and offset parameters.
  - Fetch attachments for each test case and download them to a local directory.
  - Parse and store the extracted data in structured formats (e.g., dictionaries or JSON files).

#### **7.1.3 Data Transformation**

- **Objective:** Map and transform TestRail data to match Xray's data format.
- **Tasks:**
  - Analyze the data structures of both TestRail and Xray.
  - Create a field mapping document to map TestRail fields to Xray fields.
  - Implement transformation functions to convert data formats, including:
    - Renaming fields.
    - Formatting text fields (e.g., converting rich text to Markdown or HTML).
    - Handling custom fields and ensuring they are appropriately mapped or created in Xray.
  - Prepare the data in the format required by Xray's API (e.g., JSON payloads).

#### **7.1.4 Data Import into Xray**

- **Objective:** Import the transformed data into Xray, creating test cases and maintaining hierarchy.
- **Tasks:**
  - Set up an API client for Xray, authenticating using API keys.
  - Test connectivity by creating a sample test case in Xray via API.
  - Implement functions to create folders or test sets in Xray to replicate the section hierarchy.
  - Import test cases using the transformed data.
  - Upload attachments and associate them with the corresponding test cases.
